# Lab 13
### 04/07/2021
Today we added in new structures to the lab. We removed the need to rely on the DbContext file and isntead created
some interface files and then created a service for them that used the methods we created in the interface to do the same thing that 
DbContext was doing. 


# Lab 14
### 04/08/2021
Routes: TBD
I started work on adding the routes and I added the task to create and delete amentities in the IRoom interface. 



# Lab 17 ---- Lab Async-Inn-Final
